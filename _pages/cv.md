Education
======
* Ph.D in Statistics, Cornell University, 2022
* M.S. in Probability and Mathematical Statistics, Shandong University, 2017
* B.S. in Statistics, Shandong University, 2014

Work experience
======
* 08/2022 – present: Applied Scientist
  * Amazon.com. Full-time.
  * Work in the research team for Percolate, the content optimization system including Amazon homepage,
browse, detail page, etc; design evaluation metrics to enables content providers leveraging Percolate to gain insights around strategy-level ranking performance; facilitate external quick-start guide and code repository for self-service on running more efficient analysis (10x faster) on large scale data; design metrics for internal usage for Percolate team to disambiguate the model performance, enabling root cause finding and ranking improvement; improve personalized recommendation performance

* 06/2021 – 08/2021: Applied Scientist 
  * Amazon.com. Intern.
  * Develop a Position Effect Model to estimate the causal effect of the positions of items displayed on search page, on the probability of purchases/clicks; a novel technique for de-biasing causal parameters in high dimensional models is applied to recover more accurate position effect; model implementation is designed for algorithmic improvement which works 5x faster than the open source algorithms (python(sklearn) and R(glm)); improve ranking efficiency and user experience
